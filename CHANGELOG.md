## [1.1.0] - 2026-01-31

### Added

- **Lighthouse 100/100/100/100**: Achieved perfect scores across Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices, and SEO.
- **Font Preloading**: Implemented critical font preloading for `Outfit` and `Inter Variable` to eliminate request chains and reduce LCP.
- **Responsive Images**: Optimized profile and hero images with multi-resolution scaling using Astro's `widths` and `sizes`.

### Changed

  - Increased minimum font sizes to 12px (`text-xs`) across all navigational and metadata elements.
  - Hardened color contrast ratios to pass WCAG AAA (Zinc-900 for muted text).
  - Improved link descriptions for screen readers and SEO (e.g., "See all posts" instead of "See all").

  - Redesigned header to gracefully handle long site titles without layout breakage.
  - Compacted navigation layout and gaps for better screen space efficiency.
  - Improved typography tracking for better legibility on high-resolution displays.

### Fixed
