title: "I'm Astronaut, a software designer and entrepreneur."
---

I've been obsessed with computers since I was a kid, though I didn't start coding until I was in my late teens. I'm a self-taught developer who loves the intersection of design and technology.

Currently, I'm building **Spaceship**, a modern blog template that combines the power of Astro 5, Svelte 5, and Tailwind 4. This project is my attempt at creating a perfect balance between performance and developer experience.

Beyond work, I'm an avid reader, amateur astronomer, and coffee enthusiast. I believe that the best products are built at the intersection of curiosity and craftsmanship.
